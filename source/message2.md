## 電容的原理

電容器（Capacitor）是兩金屬板之間存在絕緣介質的一種電路元件。其單位為法拉，符號為F。電容器利用二個導體之間的電場來儲存能量，二導體所帶的電荷大小相等，但符號相反。

若根據國際單位制，若一電容器兩極施加一伏特的電壓，其儲存電荷量為一庫侖，則此電容器的電容量為一法拉（F）。在實務上，法拉是相當大的單位，電容器的電容量一般常以毫法拉 (mF, 1mF = 10-3F)、微法拉 (µF, 1µF = 10-6F)、納法拉 (nF, 1nF = 10-9F) 或皮法拉 (pF, 1pF = 10-12F)表示。

Nollet 是一個對電學特別有興趣的法國神父，1746 年時、他做了一個實驗

Nollet was particularly interested in the new science of electricity, which he explored with the help of Du Fay and Réaumur. He joined the Royal Society of London in 1734 and later became the first professor of experimental physics at the University of Paris. He is reputed to have given the name to the Leyden jar after it was invented by Pieter van Musschenbroek.

In 1746 he gathered about two hundred monks into a circle about a mile (1.6 km) in circumference, with pieces of iron wire connecting them. He then discharged a battery of Leyden jars through the human chain and observed that each man reacted at substantially the same time to the electric shock, showing that the speed of electricity's propagation was very high. In 1748 he discovered the phenomenon of osmosis in natural membranes.

In 1750 Nollet made some advances on electrospray. He noted water flowing from a vessel would aerosolize if the vessel was electrified and placed near electrical ground. He also noted that similarly “a person, electrified by connection to a high-voltage generator, would not bleed normally if he were to cut himself; blood would spray from the wound.”
